### "Garage Manager" is a garage management system, that allows the real-time tracking and monitoring of different car repair stages.

**This project applies the principles of object-oriented programming and has a clear separation of the logical part _(GarageLogic)_ and UI _(ConsoleUI)_. That makes possible to use it with other user interfaces and not just as a console application.**

**The using of polymorphism in the logical part _(ConsolUI)_ makes this project more general and flexible to the future changes and updates**
